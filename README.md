**Note** : in this repository you will find only the java & XML files, so in order to get this code to work, copy this folder in `your_Project/App/` along with your build folder

**Side Note** : This Project was done in 2019, and I lost a lot of data (screenshots and videos), but it has alot of features like video player, pdf reader...etc. Download the code and have fun with it :)
